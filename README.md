<h5>TASK 1</h5>
<h5>TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION</h5>
<p>Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.</p>

<h5>TASK 2</h5>
<h5>IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION</h5>
<p>The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.</p>
